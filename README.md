# Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing the sales performance of Blinkit, a quick-commerce grocery platform. The dashboard provides business-critical insights across product categories, delivery performance, regional contribution, and SKU-level sales trends.


## Objective

To develop a dynamic sales performance dashboard that enables quick decision-making by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), identifying best- and least-performing products, and highlighting sales trends and operational gaps.

## Key Features

- KPI Cards: Total Sales, No. of Orders, Units Sold, and Average Order Value
- Sales Trend Line Chart: Monthly revenue trend to identify growth or decline
- Delivery Time Analysis: On-time vs delayed order breakdown
- Category Performance: Average sales by product category
- Top 10 Products: Highest grossing SKUs
- Bottom 10 Products: Underperforming SKUs
- Region-wise Analysis: State-level sales contribution by category
- Interactive Slicers: Filter by product, category, state, payment method, and delivery status


## Insights Summary

-Pharmacy, Fruits & Vegetables, and Dairy & Breakfast are top-performing categories in terms of average sales.
-Health-related SKUs like Vitamins and Cough Syrup lead in total sales, crossing ₹2 lakh.
-A recent decline in monthly sales signals a need for marketing or operational review.
-Only 69% of deliveries are on time; improving this can directly boost customer satisfaction.
-Least-performing products may benefit from improved visibility, bundling, or discounts.
-Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana are the highest-contributing states.
